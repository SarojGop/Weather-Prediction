Weather Prediction Application is developed using C++ Programming Language. The application predicts annual average temperature of New York City.   I chose New York City to test my prediction application . The application uses 50 years data of New York cityâ€™s average temperature from year 1968 to 2017. The data has been taken for http://www.noaa.gov/.

The data plays an important role in this application for predicting average temperature for future years.  Based on data, the prediction algorithm will calculate future average temperature using mathematical formula of Least Squares Regression line. Weather Prediction Application predicts information about future temperature of New York City. The user need to provide the year for which the user wants to predicts the average temperature
